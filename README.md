# Data Engineering ZoomCamp - Module 5 - Batch

This is the fifth issue of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp repositories.

In this ocasion we had to use Apache Spark to process a dataset in batch
in a local setup.

All the questions have been solved by using the Python version of the query,
although they could had been solved also by using the SQL version.

Using SQL allows for easy migration of those queries to a data warehouse or
some other DDBB engine, while the Python code can be better for some
queries that are not easy to express in SQL.

All the queries and their answers can be seen in the jupyter notebook.
